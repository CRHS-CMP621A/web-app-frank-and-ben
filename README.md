### Problem Or Situation to Improve
>Provide some background context / research / description of the problem that exists that you are trying to solve.  
Audience: Who would use your product and where? 
If you are re-building an app that already exists, then explain what the issue is with the current app that you want to improve.

The problem we're trying to solve is the lack of the normal last.fm site's friend interaction, so what we're making is a tool to increase the level of interactivity by putting lots of eye-catching info all in one spot for a user to look at their own, but also compare easily with others, their last.fm stats.

Our audience overall are last.fm users, regardless of age or anything, but the focus is for people who really enjoy last.fm's existing functionality, but wish there were more social elements easily acessible to them.

#### Short Product Description 
>Imagine that you met a tech investor at your high school graduation who asked about your project. How would you pitch your product? 
(You can describe your ‘dream’ solution even if your actual product did not get fully built during the semester)

 It'll show things like their own & friend's recent tracks, artists and albums along with their all-time tops of each one. There will also be a set of leaderboards with different filters and options for comparing you and your friend's last.fm stats.
